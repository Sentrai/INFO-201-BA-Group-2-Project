# INFO-201-BA-Group-2-Project
This project explores the NSDUH, National Survey on Drug Use and Health data to make insights about the usage of drugs and access to mental health care, to various age groups. Provided are 3 charts and summaries about findings through the visualizations of each chart. BSAE, or Bayes State Area Estimation is a statistical value from NSDUH that represents the prevalence rate of a category on the survey. Higher BSAE values represent a higher prevalence, or more "yes" responses in the survey.
